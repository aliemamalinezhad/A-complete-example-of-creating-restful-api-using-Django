Django-Rest-Framework complete example


Hello There.

I was always looking for a greate framework to create restful api easily. Since most of the time create a complete and powerful rest api with authentication and authoriation is not easiest thing to do.
I suggest Django Rest Framework which is very very powerful and simple.

In this repo I have created restful api about programming languages, programmers and prodigms that you can find here many things that you need for production such as JWT for autorization and authentication system. setting access to users .
I hope you enjoy it.

Special thanks to https://prettyprinted.com which is one of the best Resources.
